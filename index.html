            It's been a month since rohit bumped into ishika, they ve not talked at all.Sometimes they meet each other on elevator,
            Rohit is still embarrassed  about that encounter. He tries to apologize but shies away. Often when they meet each 
            other, rohit watches her shyly.One day Rohit took the courage to apologize to her.
            Rohit-"Sorry for bumping into you on that day"
            Ishika- "it's ok". She gave a him a smile and walks away.Rohit felt a sigh of relief.

            Since that day, rohit started to open up.Ishika always used to gentle  smile when she used to talk with 
            rohit about the project. Her smile has a charm which was unnoticeable.
            Rohit on his way home starts to think if he certainly has feelings for her.He searched on Instagram "Ishika Bose". 
            
            Should i sent her a follow request "? He murmured himself. "What she will think?that i am stalking her in social media ".
            he again murmured but her smile flashed before his eyes and he took the chance ,sent the request both in 
            Instagram and Facebook

            Next day a surprise was waiting for him.Ishika accepted his request, even followed him back. He was excited. 
            "Should I sent her hi?" But he backed up saying "maybe later".

            He was reaching for the elevator, elevator gate was closing but it suddenly opened, surprisingly Ishika 
            was the one who stopped the lift for him. Rohit Thanks her  with a pleased smile.

            On that day, Rohit did not get much chance to talk with her.On reaching home rohit messeged her "hi"
            He was waiting if she would reply. Suddenly to his surprise  after 10 mins a reply came "hey".

            The next day Rohit was all excited to go to his office again. This is the fist occasion, that he is eager
             to go to office.Rohit reaches his office before 15-20 mins. On entering his dome, he was eagerly looking
            for Ishika but she has not arrived.Rohit thought that maybe he has arrived too early.

            Ishika reaches to office 15 minutes late.She was gasping as she had ran after getting of from the bus.
            Today, in the office,  she was not herself. Something was bothering her.At break rohit tried to approach 
            her,but she was all the same .
            Rohit-Hey, how are you?
            Ishika-Hm(replied  absent-mindedly)
            Rohit-(Noticing she is worried a bit) everything ok?
            Ishika- Yeah.

            Ishika a 23 year old girl, lives in belgharia. She has been in a relationship with a guy named Avik for 2 
            years.Two days before, they had fell out.Neither Avik is picking her phone nor replying to her messages. She
            is worried , tensed and sad at the same time. Avik is a little hot headed. Maybe she shouldn't ve yelled at 
            him what should be is his most priorities.Avik and Ishika both studied at the same college. While Ishika 
            pursued  a career in IT, Avik wanted to be entrepreneur. Recently,  Avik could not give time to Ishika as he 
            was very busy regarding funding of his start up.Ishika called again  but no response from Avik.

            The next day, Ishika was very worried, she decided to pay Avik a visit after returning from office. After
            reaching home, she was surprised to see a bouquet full of rose at her doorstep with a message written on 
            it "Sorry! My Love".
            Suddenly Rohit came from behind and grabbed her eyes.Ishika turned back and was so happy to see him again.
            They hugged and kissed each other.Avik took her in her arms , goes inside.They undress themselves  and 
            started to make out but in meanwhile, while making they even forgot to close their windows. 
            Surprise! Surprise!
